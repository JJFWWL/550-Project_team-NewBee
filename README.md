repository for 2022 spring 550 team NewBee project
##Introduction
We love food, we like making friends, and we care about our health. We would like to combine all these in one app -the Foodbook, which allows us to search businesses, to find people who have interests in the same 
businesses/restaurants like we do, and to satisfy our endless curiosity to discover the characteristics of the businesses and the relationship between health rankings and them. With this motivation, we used the Yelp 
datasets that contain businesses, reviews, users, and photos, with the County Health Rankings datasets that contain health ranking of each county, to create a website application.
